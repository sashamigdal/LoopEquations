      X. Discussion. This theory contradicts accepted paradigms about energy cascades, scaling laws, etc. Let us discuss it.
      <ul>
        <li>A. Myth and Reality of Turbulent Scaling Laws. Most of the phenomenological theories in the past were myths, based on stretching the data and wishful thinking.</li>
        <li>B. Stochastic solution of the Navier-Stokes equation and ergodic hypothesis. Our theory is an exact stochastic solution of the Navier-Stokes equation. What is the analog of ergodic hypothesis?</li>
        <li>C. The physical meaning of the loop equation and dimensional reduction. How come the 3D classical turbulence reduced to a one-dimensional system?</li>
        <li>D. Classical Flow and Quantum Mechanics. The most important section. Spontaneous quantization of nonlinear classical system</li>
        <li>E. Renormalizability of the Inviscid Limit of the Loop Equation. Analogy with QCD. How the parameters in the loop equation must be tuned to get nontrivial continuum limit?</li>
        <li>F. Relation of Our Solution to Weak Turbulence. In the Navier-Stokes equation, Wylde diagrams can represent the terms of the expansion in inverse viscosity powers. Our solution can be regarded as an exact summation of that expansion with extrapolation to zero viscosity.</li>
